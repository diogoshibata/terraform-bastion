# Creating and managing the Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) cluster

There are many ways to create a OKE Cluster and you will follow by the most simple: a Quick Creation option with no personalization.

## Creating the OKE Managed Service

Menu --> Developer Services --> Container Clusters (OKE)

![OKE](images/oke01.png)

Select the correct Compartment (*OKE-Workshop*) and click the **Create Cluster** button.

Change the name of the cluster to cluster-workshop and analyze the other data. The panel shows information about the cluster creation. After that click the **Create** button.

Data:

* Name: cluster-workshop
* Kubernetes Version: v1.13.5
* [x] Quick Create
* [x] Private
* Shape: VM.Standard2.1
* Number of Nodes: 3
* Public SSH Key: *leave blank*
* [x] Kubernetes Dashboard enabled
* [x] Tiller (Helm) enabled
* [x] View Detail Page after this cluster is requested

After the network resources are created, you will see the summary bellow. Click the **Close** button to proceed.

You will be redirected to the Cluster Details page. The creation of the cluster will take some time to finish because a transparent Managed Master Node is provisioned before the Worker Nodes are created.

After the creation is completed succesfully, access the section Getting Started.

You will see some information to start the management and the use of the Kubernetes cluster. Click the **Access Kubeconfig** button.

![OKE](images/oke09.png)

It will open a box with 3 commands:

1. The first creates a directory to export the kubeconfig file.
2. The second generates the kubeconfig file using the already configured (by Terraform) OCI CLI application. **This command is diferent for every cluster**.

* The third sets the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

Copy the three commands for future use.

The cluster is ready to be used, so let's get inside our Bastion Host VM to start manage the cluster.

## Configuring the Bastion Host VM for your OKE Cluster

You will need to connect to your VM and configure the access to your specifc cluster. You will have to tunnel your remote Bastion Host VM and your local machine at port 8001 to manage from localhost your Kubernetes Dashboard.

So, let's do it!

### For Linux/MacOS environments

Open the terminal and type:

    ssh opc@'your_remote_bastion_ip_address' -i 'your_oci_api_key_local_path'/oci_api_key.pem -L 8001:localhost:8001

### For Windows environments

Here you have 2 options:

* Windows PowerShell:

Open the PowerShell terminal and type:

    ssh opc@'your_remote_bastion_ip_address' -i 'your_oci_api_key_local_path'/oci_api_key.pem -L 8001:localhost:8001

* Windows PuTTY:
  * Session
    * Host Name (or IP Address): 'your_remote_bastion_ip_address'
  * Connection
    * Data
      * Auto-login username: opc
  * Connection
    * SSH
      * Auth
        * Private key file for authentication: 'your_oci_api_key_local_path'/oci_api_key.ppk
  * Connection
    * SSH
      * Tunnels
        * Source port: 8001
        * Destination: localhost:8001
        * Click the **Add** button
  * Session
    * Saved Sessions: OKE Workshop
  * Click the **Save** button
  * Click the **Open** button

After you connect to your Bastion Host VM, run the following commands:

    oci setup repair-file-permissions --file /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key.pem

![PuTTY](images/putty01.png)

Now you are ready to run the commands of the "Getting Started" session of the Cluster Details page and, after that, run the following commands

    cat ~/.kube/config | grep token && cat ~/.kube/config | grep server
    kubectl proxy

![PuTTY](images/putty02.png)

and access the Kubernetes from your local browser through the localhost address:

<http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/>

You must select the Token option and paste the token you can get from the shell terminal.

You are logged in the Kubernetes Dashboard!

Now you can much easily follow the steps of [Container Native Development Workshop](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/container-native-development/?version=Virtual+Box&page=LabGuide100.md) that is partially translated (with some more explanations) on [this manual](https://www.manula.com/manuals/hoshikawa-cristiano/devops-containers/1/pt/topic/devops-com-oracle-container-pipelines)
