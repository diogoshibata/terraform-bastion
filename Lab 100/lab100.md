# Using the Resource Manager to create infrastructure resources and configure Bastion Host VM

 The labs from 040 to 070 were simplified into this one Terraform group file. The .zip file can be found at [/terraform/terraform.zip](https://github.com/diogoshibata/terraform-bastion/blob/master/terraform/terraform.zip).
