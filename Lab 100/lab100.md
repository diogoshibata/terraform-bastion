# Using the Resource Manager to create infrastructure resources and configure Bastion Host VM

 The labs from 040 to 070 were simplified into this one Terraform zip file. It can be found at [/terraform/terraform.zip](https://github.com/diogoshibata/terraform-bastion/blob/master/terraform/terraform.zip). It's a simplification made exclusively for this workshop and, if you want to use it as base for the creation of your own scripts, I highly recommend you to remove any sensitive data that could be exposed (like Auth Token and Keys' information).

## Using the Terraform Zip File

First of all, [download the zip file](https://github.com/diogoshibata/terraform-bastion/raw/master/terraform/terraform.zip) (/terraform/terraform.zip) to a local area. You will need to upload it to the Resource Manager.

I also encourage you to explore and understand the code of the files in the zip file.
